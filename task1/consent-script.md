# Consent Script (Verbal) — Task 1 Pilots

Use this as a short, consistent script. You can paraphrase, but keep the meaning the same.

## Quick setup (for the facilitator)

- Participant label: **P#** (no real names)
- Session code (sid): **P#_xxxx**
- Mode: **JS-on (HTMX)** or **JS-off (No-JS)**
- No audio/video recording

## Read-aloud script

Hi — thanks for helping with a short pilot of our task manager prototype. This session will take about **15–20 minutes**.

I’ll ask you to try **four small tasks**. While you work, I’ll time each task and write down what happens.  
**This is a test of the interface, not a test of you** — there are no right or wrong answers.

### What we will record
- Time taken per task
- Whether you completed the task
- Errors (e.g., submitting an empty title)
- A quick confidence rating after each task (1–5)
- My written observations, and short quotes if you’re comfortable

### What we will NOT record
- Your name, email, student ID, or anything that identifies you
- Any audio or video recordings

Your data will be linked only to an anonymous session code: **`[SESSION_ID]`**.

Participation is voluntary. You can stop at any time or skip any task/question, with no penalty.  
If you later want your data removed, tell me your session code and I will delete the matching notes/log entries.

Do you have any questions?

**Do you consent to continue?** (Wait for a clear “yes”.)

## If they say “no”
No problem — thank you for your time.
