## 1) Introduction (Read or show to participant)

Hi, thanks for taking part.  
I’m evaluating my course project website, [YOUR WEBSITE / APP NAME], to understand how well it supports different people and interaction styles (mouse, keyboard-only, screen reader, and no-JS use).

This session will take about **[10–20] minutes**.

Participation is **voluntary**. You can stop at any time, skip any task or question, and you don’t need to give a reason.

---

## 2) What you will do

You will be asked to complete a small set of realistic tasks on my website, such as:

- **T1**: [e.g., Find / filter / navigate to ...]
- **T2**: [e.g., Edit / update ...]
- **T3**: [e.g., Create / submit ...]
- **T4**: [e.g., Delete / confirm ...]
(Tasks may be done with [mouse / keyboard / screen reader / no-JS], depending on the pilot setup.)

I’m testing the design, not you. If something is confusing or frustrating, that’s useful feedback.

## 3) What data I will collect

During the tasks I will collect:

### Quantitative (metrics)
- Task completion (completed / not completed)
- Time on task
- Error count (e.g., wrong clicks, validation failures)
- Optional: number of hints needed

### Qualitative
- Observations and quotes (what you say / what I notice)

### Recording (choose one)
- [ ] **No recording** (notes only)
- [ ] **Screen recording** (screen only)
- [ ] **Audio recording** (voice only)
- [ ] **Screen + audio recording**

If recording is enabled, you can ask me to pause or stop recording at any point.

## 4) Privacy, anonymity, and storage

- I will **not** collect real names, emails, phone numbers, or other identifying information.
- In my notes and CSV files, you will be referenced only as **P1 / P2 / P3 / P4** (participant ID).
- Any metrics exported (e.g., `metrics.csv`) will be anonymised (no real names/emails).  
- Data is used only for this coursework submission and will be stored in my private course repository / local drive.

## 5) Risks and benefits

Risks are minimal, but you might feel mild frustration if something is hard to use. You may take a break or stop at any time.

There is no direct benefit to you, but your feedback helps improve the design and accessibility of the project.
