**Confidence**: 5/5

---

### Debrief Notes
**Most confusing**:
- “Cancel in edit mode — I wasn’t 100% sure if cancel would keep changes.”

**Most helpful**:
- “Instant feedback when filtering and adding.”

**Moments of uncertainty (“did it work?”)**:
- Brief moment after Save until status message appeared.

**Accessibility / Inclusion notes**:
- Keyboard navigation: Mostly used keyboard; buttons reachable.
- Focus visibility: Focus indicator visible enough for this user.
- Status/confirmation messaging: Noticed and relied on it.
- No-JS parity (if applicable): N/A (JS-on).
- Anything else: None.
