### Task 1: Filter (and optionally complete a task)
**Start**: 11:42:15 → **End**: 11:43:05 = **50 seconds**
**Success**: 1
**Errors**: 0
**Confidence**: 4/5
**Observations**:
- Used Tab to reach filter input; typed `report`.
- Appreciated that results changed without leaving the page.
- Count was visible; user announced it out loud while counting.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “Okay, now it’s only the report ones.”

---

### Task 2: Add New Task
**Start**: 11:43:35 → **End**: 11:44:10 = **35 seconds**
**Success**: 1
**Errors**: 0
**Confidence**: 5/5
**Observations**:
- Reached add input with Tab; typed title; pressed Enter to submit.
- Success message appeared; user stayed on keyboard.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “Nice, I didn’t need the mouse.”

---

### Task 3: Inline Edit (update an existing task title)
**Start**: 11:44:45 → **End**: 11:46:40 = **115 seconds**
**Success**: 1
**Errors**: 1 (accidentally activated Delete instead of Edit once; did not submit)
**Confidence**: 3/5
**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only navigation through each task’s buttons took time; user said “too many tabs”.
- When Edit opened, focus moved to input (good), but returning to the list after save was a bit disorienting.
- User wanted a “skip to task list” shortcut after save.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “That’s a lot of tabbing to reach Edit.”

---

### Task 4: Delete a Task
**Start**: 11:47:10 → **End**: 11:48:05 = **55 seconds**
**Success**: 1
**Errors**: 0
**Confidence**: 4/5
**Observations**:
- Keyboard reached Delete; confirmation dialog appeared; user confirmed.
- After deletion, focus jumped somewhere unexpected; user had to tab around to re-find position.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “Where did my focus go?”

---

### Debrief Notes
**Most confusing**:
- “After deletion, I lost my place.”

**Most helpful**:
- Keyboard support is there; editing works once you reach it.

**Moments of uncertainty (“did it work?”)**:
- Mostly after delete (focus jump), not after save.

**Accessibility / Inclusion notes**:
- Keyboard navigation: Works but inefficient to reach per-item controls.
- Focus visibility: Visible; main issue was focus *location* after swaps.
- Status/confirmation messaging: Helpful; user noticed it.
- No-JS parity (if applicable): N/A.
- Anything else: Suggested better keyboard shortcuts / grouping controls.
