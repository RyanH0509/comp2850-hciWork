### Task 1: Filter (and optionally complete a task)
**Start**: 11:07:20 → **End**: 11:08:45 = **85 seconds**  
**Success**: 1  
**Errors**: 1 (entered filter but forgot to submit/apply once)  
**Confidence**: 3/5  
**Observations**:
- Typed `report` but paused expecting auto-update; nothing happened.
- Eventually pressed Enter and page reloaded; then counted results.

**Quotes (optional)**:
- “I thought it would filter as I type.”

**Success**: 1  
**Errors**: 1 (blank submission once)  
**Confidence**: 4/5  
**Observations**:
- Submitted blank → page reloaded; error text appeared, but user initially missed it.
- User scrolled up to find what happened; then typed title and submitted again.
- After success, user wasn’t sure it worked until they scanned list and found the new item.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “Did it do anything? …oh, I see it now.”

### Task 3: Inline Edit (update an existing task title)
**Start**: 11:10:50 → **End**: 11:12:25 = **95 seconds**  
**Success**: 1  
**Errors**: 0  
**Confidence**: 3/5  
**Observations**:
- Clicked Edit → full page load to edit view; user said it felt “like a different page”.
- After Save, another reload; user looked for a clear confirmation.
- User found the updated title but wanted a stronger success cue.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “It feels like I got moved somewhere else.”

---

**Success**: 1  
**Errors**: 0  
**Confidence**: 2/5  
**Observations**:
- Clicked Delete; no confirmation; page reloaded.
- User worried they might delete the wrong thing: “That’s scary.”
- Checked list carefully to confirm removal.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “That’s scary—no ‘are you sure?’”

### Debrief Notes
**Most confusing**:
- Filter behavior: expected it to update without needing a “submit” action.

**Most helpful**:
- “It still works without JS, but it’s slower.”

**Moments of uncertainty (“did it work?”)**:
- After add/edit/delete, user relied on scanning the list (no clear immediate feedback).

**Accessibility / Inclusion notes**:
- Keyboard navigation: Works, but reloads break flow.
- Focus visibility: Fine when tabbing, but focus position resets after reload.
- Status/confirmation messaging: User missed messages if they weren’t near top.
- No-JS parity (if applicable): Feature parity exists, but usability parity is weaker.
- Anything else: Requested clearer confirmations + delete safety.
