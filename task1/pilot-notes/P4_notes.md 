### Task 1: Filter (and optionally complete a task)
**Start**: 12:17:10 → **End**: 12:19:05 = **115 seconds**
**Success**: 1
**Errors**: 2 (forgot to submit once; lost focus after reload once)
**Confidence**: 2/5
**Observations**:
- Tabbing to filter input was okay; user typed `report` and expected update; nothing changed.
- Pressed Enter → reload; focus returned to top; user had to tab back down.
- User said counting results after reload felt “annoying”.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “It reset me back to the top.”

### Task 2: Add New Task
**Start**: 12:19:40 → **End**: 12:21:05 = **85 seconds**
**Success**: 1
**Errors**: 1 (blank submit once)
**Confidence**: 3/5
**Observations**:
- Blank submit → reload; error message existed but user did not land near it; took time to find.
- After successful add, again reload → user had to tab a lot to locate the new entry.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “I’m not sure what changed.”

---

### Task 3: Inline Edit (update an existing task title)
**Start**: 12:21:40 → **End**: 12:23:55 = **135 seconds**
**Success**: 0 (abandoned)
**Errors**: 1 (couldn’t reliably reach the right Edit with keyboard after reloads)
**Confidence**: 1/5
**Observations**:
- Entered edit mode via keyboard, but after Save attempt the page reloaded and user lost position.
- User struggled to confirm whether changes applied; requested “clear success message”.
- After ~3 minutes, facilitator moved to next task.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “I keep losing where I am.”

---

### Task 4: Delete a Task
**Start**: 12:24:30 → **End**: 12:25:55 = **85 seconds**
**Success**: 1
**Errors**: 0
**Confidence**: 2/5
**Observations**:
- No confirmation step; user worried about accidental deletion.
- After reload, user had to search by tabbing to verify removal.
**Quotes (optional)**:
- “I wish it asked me before deleting.”

---

### Debrief Notes
**Most confusing**:
- “The page reload resets my position, and I don’t know what changed.”

**Most helpful**:
- “It works eventually, but it’s slow without the mouse.”

**Moments of uncertainty (“did it work?”)**:
- Nearly every reload; especially after edit and delete.

**Accessibility / Inclusion notes**:
- Keyboard navigation: Technically possible, but high effort in no-JS mode.
- Focus visibility: Visible, but focus resets to top on every reload.
- Status/confirmation messaging: Easy to miss (not anchored to focus).
- No-JS parity (if applicable): Functional parity exists; experience parity is poor for keyboard-only.
- Anything else: Strong candidate issues for redesign: focus management, clearer confirmations, delete safety.
